If you're seeing this code, something went wrong.  I was given very, very
clear instructions to race out a version absolutely as fast as possible,
that would be thrown out and replaced by the next version, intended to be
written in Drupal 7 simultaneously with this.  It is not supposed to be
extensible, maintainable or documented, according to my instuctions.

Sincerely,
I don't want my name here
