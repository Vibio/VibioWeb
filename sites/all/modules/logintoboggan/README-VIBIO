There was a slightly modified logintoboggan, based on v.1.7, 
that blocked non-email logins.  Never discovered if this was 
feature or bug, but there'd been no attempt to reword.

It seemed to be the root of a couple errors.  Upgraded to 1.9 
ignoring overwriting all the hacks on 20110920

That original module has been moved to stephen's home dir
