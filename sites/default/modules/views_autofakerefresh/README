From views_hacks and modified by stephen, probably very heavily

This module normally updates a view with new incoming information using ajax...
we're faking that, pretending new information is coming in.

In the future, we might have it test to see if new information has come in,
and maybe start over?  Could easily get way to complex for a toy
