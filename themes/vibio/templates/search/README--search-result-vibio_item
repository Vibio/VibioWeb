There seems to be a half-done effort to convert search from 4[adjustable] columns
in a simple, solid but slightly clunky way to some cool javascript or ???

At some point this work could be taken up again, the old file is being left.

If so, get rid of / transform function vibio_preprocess_search_results(&$variables) {
in template.php
