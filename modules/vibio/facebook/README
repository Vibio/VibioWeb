This *appears* to be a heavily cut and rewritten[?] version of the fb
or Drupal for Facebook module.  Many pieces are missing, including
the very helpful README.  I[stephen] downloaded that module to 
mylaptop/Downloads/fb
as a reference.

No, although this uses Drupal for Facebook's module naming convention,
	for example fb.admin.inc is in common, it seems completely rewritten
	or done from scratch.  I don't know what I'm looking at.  Why name
	the module facebook and then use fb as the module name unless you're
	copying from fb module?  But this looks as if that were open in 
	another window and used as an educational tool to write something
	from scratch.  Or could it be an older version was used as a reference?
