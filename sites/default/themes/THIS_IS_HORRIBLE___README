When I merged Carolyn's code with mine on 8/22, somehow... not sure how... 
it started looking in the natural place (here) for the Vibio theme.
This link solved problems I don't have another hour or two to track down.
Hope we can get rid of this spaghetti before anyone has to track it down
or fix it!

Hm... after merging code, it's sometimes looking here: sites/all/themes/vibio/templates/profile/display-block.tpl.php
when this fubar site should look
sites/all/themes/vibio/templates/profile/display-block.tpl.php
what made it do that?
ouch, but try: ln -s /home/ubuntu/www/vibio/src/themes/vibio vibio
ln -s /home/ubuntu/www/vibio/src/themes/zen  zen
