These modules were pulled out of the core directory by Stephen
in heading from v1.0 (live spring 2011) to v1.1

...

This directory is reserved for core module files. Custom or contributed
modules should be placed in their own subdirectory of the sites/all/modules
directory. For multisite installations, they can also be placed in a subdirectory
under /sites/{sitename}/modules/, where {sitename} is the name of your site
(e.g., www.example.com). This will allow you to more easily update Drupal core files.
